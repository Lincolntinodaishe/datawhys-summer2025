    "\n",
    "p-value (3.207e-09): The p-value is extremely small (far below the typical significance threshold of 0.05), indicating strong statistical evidence that the distribution of response labels changed significantly from before to after the lessons.\n",

    "Degrees of Freedom (dof): Not provided in the output, but typically calculated as (rows - 1) * (columns - 1) = (2 - 1) * (6 - 1) = 5, which is consistent with a 2x6 contingency table.\n",

    "\n",
    "# Mixed Outcomes: \n",
    "The increase in 'yes' (+11) and 'kind_of' (+45) suggests some students developed more positive attitudes or confidence, aligning with the goal of fostering caring about nature. However, the substantial increase in 'no' (+166) and slight rise in 'not_really' (+29) indicate that a notable portion of students may have become less favorable or more critical, possibly due to lesson content, engagement, or external factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Reduction in Uncertainty: \n",
    "The drop in 'i_dont_know' (-213) is a positive sign, suggesting the lessons clarified studentsâ€™ views, though the shift toward 'no' rather than 'yes' is concerning.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Contextual Consideration: \n",
    "The presence of 'unknown' responses (370 before, 328 after) might indicate data issues (e.g., values outside 1.0-5.0). Investigating these could refine the analysis."

    "The chi-square test indicates a statistically significant change in response patterns post-lesson, but the data reveals a complex picture with both positive (e.g., reduced uncertainty, slight 'yes' increase) and negative (e.g., significant 'no' rise) shifts. This suggests the lessons had an impact, but the nature of that impact varies, and further analysis is needed to understand why some studentsâ€™ attitudes worsened. Let me know if youâ€™d like to pursue any of the next steps or adjust the analysis!"

    "# Why the Discrepancy?\n",
    "Means vs. Distribution:\n",
    "Means Measure Central Tendency: The average response (e.g., 3.0 = \"i_dont_know\" to 4.0 = \"kind_of\") reflects the overall level of agreement but doesnâ€™t capture how the responses are spread across categories. Small changes in means (e.g., +0.108 or -0.066) can occur even with significant redistributions if the shifts balance out (e.g., some moving from 'i_dont_know' to 'yes', others to 'no').\n",
    "Chi-Square Measures Distribution: The chi-square test compares the observed frequency of each response category ('no', 'not_really', etc.) against what would be expected if there were no change. Even if the mean stays similar, a significant shift in the proportion of responses across categories (e.g., more 'no' and fewer 'i_dont_know') can yield a low p-value.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Large Sample Size:\n",
    "Your dataset appears to have a large number of responses (total counts sum to 6758 before and 6962 after across all categories). With large samples, even small differences in distribution can become statistically significant, leading to an extremely low p-value. The chi-square test is sensitive to sample size, and the p-value reflects this sensitivity rather than the practical importance of the change.\n",
    "Shift in Categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "The contingency table shows a notable increase in 'no' (+166) and a decrease in 'i_dont_know' (-213), with a small increase in 'yes' (+11). This redistribution, even if it doesnâ€™t move the mean much, creates a significant chi-square statistic because the observed frequencies deviate from the expected (no-change) frequencies.\n",
    "Example: If 100 students moved from 'i_dont_know' (3.0) to 'no' (1.0), the mean might only drop slightly (e.g., 3.0 to 2.9), but the category shift is detectable by chi-square."
