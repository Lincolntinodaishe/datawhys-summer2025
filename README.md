# 📊 DataWhys Summer 2025 – Data Science & Machine Learning Internship

This repository contains my work from the **DataWhys Internship Program** at the **University of Memphis** (May–July 2025), where I gained hands-on experience with real-world data science and machine learning workflows focused on solving community challenges.

## 🧠 What I Did

- Cleaned and explored real tabular datasets using Python (pandas, seaborn, Plotly)
- Built predictive models:
  - 📈 **Regression:** Simple, multiple, logistic, regression trees
  - 🧮 **Classification:** K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), decision trees, random forests
- Evaluated model performance using metrics like R², accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrices
- Created interactive visualizations and dashboards
- Pitched data-driven solutions to real community partners:  
  - 🌱 **Clean Memphis**  
  - ⚖️ **Decarcerate**  
  - 🏙️ **City Leadership**
